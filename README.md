Hello everyone, my name is Pavel "Am0k" Kolesov.
## My hobbies:
- microelectronics, circuit engineering, including the creation of embedded systems based on AVR, ARM and ESP microcontrollers (project, firmware, implementation in hardware);
- creation of CNC machines (for milling, 3D printing);
- creation of automated control systems (thermal controllers, time relays, humidity and lighting regulators);
- actual 3D printing.
